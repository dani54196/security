# AWS Security Best Practices

Securing AWS environments involves multiple layers of protection. Here are some best practices to follow:

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Use IAM roles instead of IAM users.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.

## Network Security

- Use VPCs, subnets, and security groups to segment your network.
- Enable AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- Use AWS WAF to protect web applications.

## Data Protection

- Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS.
- Enable encryption in transit using SSL/TLS.
- Use Amazon S3 bucket policies to control access to data.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Enable CloudTrail to log API activity.
- Use CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
- Set up GuardDuty for threat detection.
